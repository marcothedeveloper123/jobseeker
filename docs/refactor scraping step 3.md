Based on the insights and requirements for the `JobScraper` class, let's proceed with an implementation for Step 3 that takes into account the unique aspects of dynamic content loading, error handling, retry mechanisms, and adaptability for different job sites. Hereâ€™s a detailed proposal for the implementation of Step 3:

### Step 3: Transfer Scraping Logic to JobScraper.perform_scraping

#### Task
- Move the existing scraping loop and logic from `main()` into the `JobScraper.perform_scraping` method.

#### Proposed Implementation
1. **Class Method - `perform_scraping`**: This method will be the core of the scraping functionality. It will use other class methods like `scroll_for_dynamic_content`, `retry_operation`, and `handle_exceptions` to manage the scraping process.
   
2. **Scroll Management**:
    - Implement `scroll_for_dynamic_content` within `JobScraper`. This method will take care of the scrolling logic that is specific to LinkedIn or can be adapted for other sites. It will ensure that all necessary job postings are loaded into the page before data extraction.

3. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**:
    - The `handle_exceptions` method should wrap around the scraping operations. It will catch various exceptions (like `NoSuchElementException`, `TimeoutException`, and `WebDriverException`) and decide whether to retry the operation, skip the current task, or terminate the scraping.
    - The `retry_operation` method can be invoked within `handle_exceptions` or `perform_scraping` to retry specific operations that are prone to transient failures, such as network issues or temporary page load problems.

4. **Scraping Logic**:
    - Transfer the existing scraping logic from `main()` into `perform_scraping`. This involves moving the loop that iterates through the pages and the logic for extracting job details into this method.
    - Within this method, call `scroll_for_dynamic_content` to ensure all job postings are loaded and then proceed with data extraction.

5. **Maintaining Functionality**:
    - Ensure that the transferred logic works seamlessly within the class structure without changing the script's overall functionality.
    - Test the class method to make sure it handles dynamic content loading, error handling, and retries appropriately.

#### Verification
- Run the script to ensure that it performs scraping through the `JobScraper.perform_scraping` method without any functional change.
- Verify that the script can handle errors and network issues gracefully and manages dynamic content loading effectively.

#### Code Snippet (Pseudocode)
```python
class JobScraper:
    def __init__(self, site, query, navigator):
        # Initialization code here

    def perform_scraping(self):
        # Transferred scraping loop and logic
        try:
            for page_num in range(start_page, end_page):
                self.scroll_for_dynamic_content()
                # Extract job data
        except Exception as e:
            self.handle_exceptions(e)

    def scroll_for_dynamic_content(self):
        # Logic to manage dynamic scrolling

    def handle_exceptions(self, exception):
        # Error handling and decision-making

    def retry_operation(self, operation, max_retries):
        # Retry logic for transient failures

# In main()
scraper = JobScraper(site, query, navigator)
scraper.perform_scraping()
```

This implementation aims to encapsulate the scraping logic within a class structure, improving readability, maintainability, and adaptability for different job sites, while also robustly handling the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of web scraping with Selenium.

#### Step 3: Transfer Scraping Logic

- **Task**: Move the existing scraping loop and logic from `main()` into `JobScraper.perform_scraping`.
- **Changes**: 
  - Cut the scraping loop from `main()` and paste it into `JobScraper.perform_scraping`.
  - Ensure `perform_scraping` accounts for 25 job postings per page, with special handling for the final page.
  - Adjust `scroll_for_dynamic_content` to dynamically scroll based on the count of job postings.
  - Pass the expected number of job postings per page (25) as a parameter when initializing `JobScraper` in the main function.
  - Verify the count of job postings after scrolling in the main scraping loop within `perform_scraping`.
  - Implement exception handling for scenarios where fewer than 25 job postings are loaded.
- **Verification**: Script should perform scraping through the class method without any functional change.
