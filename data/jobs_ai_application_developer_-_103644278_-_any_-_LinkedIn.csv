Because the quality of justice in America should not depend on how much money a person has, NLADA leads a broad network of advocates on the front lines to advance justice and expand opportunity for all by promoting excellence in the delivery of legal services for people who cannot afford counsel. This new VISTA project, Defending Communities in Service, will build sustainable community relationships and data systems and practices that allow participating public defender offices to more holistically support communities in need. VISTAs will build capacity within their host organizations focused on two separate tracks of service: you will serve as the driving force connecting their hosting Public Defender office to other justice system stakeholders, community organizations and service providers, strategic leaders, and to other relevant local National Service operations. These connections will help the public defenders to more effectively provide wraparound services to their clients and to more clearly understand and communicate the overall local services landscape upon which their clients rely. All NLADA VISTA project members will explore opportunities to utilize technology and automation to create communication and data-sharing channels between public defenders and human services organizations designed to last beyond the period of their projects, with minimal maintenance required.Further help on this page can be found by  clicking here  .Member Duties : Information Technology (IT) is the central nervous system of the Santa Barbara Public Defender’s Office.

This VISTA will have one primary goal: helping to develop and maintain the re-entry app launched by the Public Defender’s Office. This app is scheduled to be launched in January 2023 but will need a lot of building as we look to develop the app over the next 1-2 years. The ThriveSBC app will offer benefits for the whole community but will be particularly valuable for justice-involved individuals, whether they are pre-entry, actively involved, or re-entering the community.
