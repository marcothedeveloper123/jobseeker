### Refactoring Plan for `JobScraper` Class Integration

#### Step 1: Class Skeleton
- **Task**: Create a basic `JobScraper` class skeleton with empty methods reflecting our design.
- **Changes**: 
  - Define the `JobScraper` class with `__init__`, `perform_scraping`, `handle_exceptions`, `retry_operation`, and `scroll_for_dynamic_content`.
- **Verification**: Ensure the script runs without implementing any functionality in the class.

#### Step 2: Initialize Class in Main
- **Task**: Initialize the `JobScraper` class in the `main()` function.
- **Changes**: 
  - Instantiate `JobScraper` in `main()` with necessary parameters (`site`, `query`, `navigator`, etc.).
- **Verification**: Script should run with the class instantiated but without any functionality change.

#### Step 3: Transfer Scraping Logic
- **Task**: Move the existing scraping loop and logic from `main()` into `JobScraper.perform_scraping`.
- **Changes**: 
  - Cut the scraping loop from `main()` and paste it into `JobScraper.perform_scraping`.
- **Verification**: Script should perform scraping through the class method without any functional change.

#### Step 4: Implement Scrolling for Dynamic Content
- **Task**: Implement the `scroll_for_dynamic_content` method in `JobScraper`.
- **Changes**: 
  - Write the logic for dynamic scrolling within the job posting list.
- **Verification**: Script should load all job postings, including those dynamically loaded.

#### Step 5: Implement Retry Logic
- **Task**: Implement the `retry_operation` method for network retries.
- **Changes**: 
  - Add retry logic for network-related operations within the `retry_operation` method.
- **Verification**: Script should handle network retries more robustly.

#### Step 6: Implement Exception Handling
- **Task**: Move exception handling into `JobScraper.handle_exceptions`.
- **Changes**: 
  - Shift all exception handling from `main()` to `JobScraper.handle_exceptions`.
- **Verification**: Script should handle exceptions as before but now within the class.

#### Step 7: Final Cleanup and Testing
- **Task**: Clean up the code and perform comprehensive testing.
- **Changes**: 
  - Remove any redundant code or comments. Ensure all class methods are used properly.
  - Perform thorough testing to confirm the functionality matches the pre-refactoring state.
- **Verification**: Script should be fully functional with a cleaner, more modular structure.
