### Plan for Iteratively Simplifying the `main()` Function

The goal is to simplify the `main()` function in a step-by-step manner, ensuring functionality is maintained at each iteration. The plan involves moving code blocks into separate functions or class methods, thereby making `main()` more concise and readable.

#### Iteration 1: Extract Argument Parsing
- **Task**: Create a function `parse_arguments()` to handle command-line argument parsing.
- **Expected Outcome**: The `main()` function will have a single line to parse arguments, making it cleaner.

#### Iteration 2: Initialize Objects in a Separate Function
- **Task**: Create a function `initialize_objects(args)` which takes the parsed arguments and initializes the `LinkedIn`, `Query`, and `WebNavigator` objects.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` will call this function to get the necessary objects, reducing its size and complexity.

#### Iteration 3: Modularize Scraping Process
- **Task**: Move the scraping logic (the loop and related operations) into a new function `perform_scraping(navigator, query, args)`.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` delegates the core scraping responsibility to this function, simplifying its structure.

#### Iteration 4: Handling Data Saving
- **Task**: Refine the `save_to_file()` function to be more versatile or create a new method in the `WebNavigator` class for saving data.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` will have a simple call to save data, encapsulating the details elsewhere.

#### Iteration 5: Streamline Exception Handling
- **Task**: Create a function `handle_exceptions()` that wraps around the scraping function to manage exceptions.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` will have a cleaner way to handle exceptions, making it easier to follow.

#### Iteration 6: Final Cleanup and Refactoring
- **Task**: Review `main()` for any remaining redundant code or operations that can be modularized.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` becomes a series of high-level function calls with clear purposes, improving readability and maintainability.

---

Each iteration will be tested to ensure that the functionality remains intact and the script continues to work as expected. This iterative approach allows for gradual improvements without disrupting the core functionality of the script.

## Iteration 1: Extract Argument Parsing
- **Task**: Create a function `parse_arguments()` to handle command-line argument parsing.
- **Expected Outcome**: The `main()` function will have a single line to parse arguments, making it cleaner.

## Iteration 2: Initialize Objects in a Separate Function
- **Task**: Create a function `initialize_objects(args)` which takes the parsed arguments and initializes the `LinkedIn`, `Query`, and `WebNavigator` objects.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` will call this function to get the necessary objects, reducing its size and complexity.

## Iteration 3: Modularize Scraping Process
- **Task**: Move the scraping logic (the loop and related operations) into a new function `perform_scraping(navigator, query, args)`.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` delegates the core scraping responsibility to this function, simplifying its structure.

## Iteration 4: Extract File Saving Logic
- **Task**: Extract the file saving logic into a separate function `save_scraped_data(jobs, query, args)`.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` and `perform_scraping()` functions become more focused and concise.

## Iteration 5: Generalize Scraping for Different Job Sites
- **Task**: Refactor `LinkedIn` and related logic to be more general, allowing for different job sites to be used. This might involve creating a base job site class and specific implementations for each site, like `LinkedIn`.
- **Expected Outcome**: The script becomes more versatile, capable of scraping from different job sites with minimal changes.

## Iteration 6: Streamline Exception Handling
- **Task**: Create a function `handle_exceptions()` that wraps around the scraping function to manage exceptions.
- **Expected Outcome**: `main()` will have a cleaner way to handle exceptions, making it easier to follow.

## Iteration 7: Cleanup and Finalization
- **Task**: Review the entire script for any remaining inefficiencies or redundant code. Ensure that all functions and classes are well-documented.
- **Expected Outcome**: The script is cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand and maintain.
